			<h2>Work Experience and Projects</h2>
			<h1>Serenity: 2022 September - 2022 December</h1>
			<p>Serenity was a project that me and 5 other students collaborated on for our SEG2900 course in the software engineering program. The goal
			was to pitch an idea and make a functioning website about the idea. We wanted to make a website about
			relaxation and aiding people with anxiety. Therefore we picked the name Serenity, as it is considered relaxing and it is easy to say.
