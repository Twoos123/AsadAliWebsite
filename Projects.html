			<h1>Work Experience and Projects</h1>
			<h3>Project: MenuMate (2023 January)</h3>
				<p>MenuMate, a web application that utilizes the latest technology to suggest the best dining options to users in Ottawa. 
					Developed in January 2023 in Montreal, QC, MenuMate employs Co:here's generation transformer and React to scrape restaurant databases for information. 
					Our team designed and implemented the application's backend using Flask for data processing and API handling. 
					To ensure that MenuMate provides the most accurate recommendations possible, we utilized data scraping techniques to gather information from various 
					restaurant databases. Finally, we designed an engaging and interactive user interface with React and Co:here, 
					ensuring that the application is user-friendly and intuitive.</p>
				<p>This was designed was by myself and 4 other talented individuals during our visit to McHacks 2023, we learnt a lot from developing this website as it taught us about databases
					and scrapping web data.

			<h3>Project: Serenity (2022 September - 2022 December)</h3>

			<p>Serenity was a project that me and 5 other students collaborated on for our SEG2900 course in the software engineering program. The goal
			was to pitch an idea and make a functioning website about the idea. We wanted to make a website about
			relaxation and aiding people with anxiety. We picked the name Serenity, as the definition of the word is <i>"the state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled"</i> which perfectly describes
			what we wanted our project to inhibit in anxious individuals. </p> 
			To create an application that was both visually appealing and user-friendly, we utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
			We also included various relaxation techniques, such as surveys and breathing exercises, to provide a comprehensive tool for managing anxiety. 
			Our aim was to create an application that would be easy to use, yet effective in helping people deal with their anxiety.
