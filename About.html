			<h2>About Myself</h2>
			<b>Hey!</b>
			<p>My name is Asad Ali, I am a Software Engineering CO-OP Student at the University Of Ottawa, currently in First Year.
			Thanks for taking a look at my website! It is still a work in progress however I am trying my best to complete it by the start of the summer!
			I enjoy learning new concepts and coding languages and thus decided to create a personal website for myself to showcase what I have to offer.
			</p>

			<p>I'd like to show you a bit more about what I'm like, what I enjoy, and how I work.</p>

			<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing games on my PC, I spend most of my free time playing CS:GO or Valorant. However I am also into watching anime and reading mangas.
				I tend to stay active, as I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I believe that health is very important and that it can affect your work ethic.
