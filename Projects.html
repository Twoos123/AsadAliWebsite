			<h3>Project: Serenity (2022 September - 2022 December)</h3>

			<div class="text">
			<p>Serenity was a project that me and 5 other students collaborated on for our SEG2900 course in the software engineering program. The goal
			was to pitch an idea and make a functioning website about the idea. We wanted to make a website about
			relaxation and aiding people with anxiety. We picked the name Serenity, as the definition of the word is <i>"the state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled"</i> which perfectly describes
			what we wanted our project to inhibit in anxious individuals.
