			<h2>About Myself</h2>
			<div class="text">
			<b>Hey!</b>
			<p>My name is Asad Ali, I am a Software Engineering CO-OP Student at the University Of Ottawa, currently in First Year.
			Thanks for taking a look at my website! It is still a work in progress however I am trying my best to complete it by the start of the summer!
			I enjoy learning new concepts and coding languages and thus decided to create a personal website for myself to showcase what I have to offer.
			</p>

			<p>I'd like to show you a bit more about what I'm like, what I enjoy, and how I work.</p>

			<p>I want to consider things before acting when I'm working. This entails carefully weighing my options at every turn and planning designs in advance using drawing
				software or in my head. By doing this, I've been able to think critically, pick up information more rapidly, and create better work.
				I also place a high value on efficiency and completing tasks quickly. I believe it's important to spend as little time as possible on mundane or repeated jobs because
				our time is valuable. I'm always searching for ways to make things go faster, whether it's via automating deployment procedures, learning new keyboard shortcuts, 
				or just organising my thoughts. It aids in my productivity and keeps things moving.
			</p>

			<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing games on my PC, I spend most of my free time playing CS:GO or Valorant. However I am also into watching anime and reading mangas.
				I tend to stay active, as I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I believe that health is very important and that it can affect your work ethic.
